# Ethereum-Smart-Contract

In this project, a smart contract has been created that processes a common asset and the distribution of income from this asset over certain time intervals. The common asset in this scenario is a taxi. A group of people who do not trust each other will buy a taxi together and the profit will be shared among the participants.The contract can run on Remix(https://remix.ethereum.org/).
